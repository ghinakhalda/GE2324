Thou art more fair than dawn,"Thou art more fair than dawn, more exquisite than flowers or fragrant zones. Brighter than golden morn splendidly attired. Thy hair is like a crown that inward glory wears, thy face like heaven when clouds are clear'd. Thou art as fair as wintry seas, as balm, as blood, as sweet as spring's first bud. Thou art the fairest that ever hath been, the fairest, yet the foulest that ever hath been. Thou art fairer than the winter's light, but thy love's hate is more than winter's night. Thou art more fair than winter's first snow, but thy love's hate is more than winter's blow. Thou art as fair as the winter's snow, but thy love's hate is more than winter's snow. Thou art as fair as the winter's snow, but thy love's hate is more than winter's snow. Thou art as fair as winter's snow, but thy love's hate is more than winter's snow. Thou art",2.2113455927155026
Shall I speak of thee now,"Shall I speak of thee now, and straight make thee a goddess? Or shall be call to the undying life? Or shall i call to life? or, calling life, see it bulge within the eye of heaven, to make the clouds more swiftly glide? Or shall i straight call on the sovreign sun, and with loud thunders cause those clouds to fly, to make the sun draw those sweet influences from the firmanent to entertain thee? Or shall i call on jove, the father of gods and all things, to give me these commanding words, and, with an oath, by thunder and a storm, conjure thee to appear before these eyes, that when i call thee, thou mayst hear me best? Nay, call on all the powers that are above, and call them all to witness on my love. What! shall i daunt thee? then, i summon up all those that ever were, or heard of, were, or are, or never shall be, gods or",2.784897540752653
Dost thy heart not tremble,"Dost thy heart not tremble for my sake? Why art thou then within thy duty sick? Why do not thy valiant arms look red? Why do not your hands tear that head? Why do not your arms hang tip-drunk by my side? Whiles the most noble blood of thee doth rise to wash the foul stains of this earth's blench'd soil from off my for-subdu'd will, and make my bosom, as in smothering heat, bath'd every hour that ever yet was hot, a sepulchre wherein to bury love? O, for my love, no merit can my bosom wring to have thee where thou art; but longs to be in-sculptured in the breast o' th' earth, and then in that to be no more seen than now a bare-boned death. What say'st thou? hast thou slain thyself in love? and not by women? women are only deathly in that: men gave my love a",2.0046158272160337
Wouldst thou linger in dream,"Wouldst thou linger in dream and delay, And be bound in a sweet sleep's chain; What, though in sleep thou shalt be gay, In sleep thou art but a dead man? Wouldst thou thy sweet blood's life away lay, And give thy life to an inconstant queen; Wouldst thou thyself in thyself destroy, And make love's pleasure but a dream? Then, love, live not, for thou dost not so; Nor thou, love, live, for thou dost not live. Live, then, that love but lives in thee; Die, then, that love as thou dost die. So live, that when thy blessed breath hath vaped, the little museum of thy heart shall be the monument of lovers ever; when as sweet smell as the first-cropt herbs shall but draw thee from thy banishment and here resolve it in a general bone; a single bone shall mingle with millions and make millions. but never thee and love again; which is contrary to the glory that the",3.6348264387893523
Speak not of sorrow again,"Speak not of sorrow again. Speak not of love again to me: Speak not of life again, but when of life and love and sorrow we are dead. For, speak but little, love, and I shall hear enough: Hear enough, and thou shalt think me dead: Think me dead, and thou shalt see how much I love. -Edmund Spenser, ""Sonnet: To His Dying Father""",3.902414839299882
Let not time steal thee,"Let not time steal thee from flight to joys above; for thou, my friend, art growing to a man. Why hast thou left the thing thou judgedst so well, to change thy countenance? it hath thine eyes; thy tongue, thy hands, thy sides, thy feet,--but thy fair oil thou hast left within; and thou, instead, hast balm to suffer wrong, and he, himself the monument of lies, was filled with verity. false was that fair, and thereon did depend thy love and thoughts' complexion; for thou loved'st it for the name which it had, and for the fame which hath resounded so, thy tongue, by that invention, still did sing their greatness, to the slander of thy judgement, defacing it with's own shadow. those whom thou think'st were thy friends are thine own foes, thyself the fruit thou cast'st away, wert thou thyself but rude to thy fair name, or bad'st",1.7890446601949426
Wherefore dost thou retreat so,"Wherefore dost thou retreat so far from me? Is not my bosom, as his throne on high, More than thy graces to the sovereign eye? Oh, why doth thy beauty, from me, fly? Thou dost pursue him, that has more than thou, Who hunts for beauty and for beauty dies. He lives in thee, and thou in him dost dwell, Thou in him dwelling dost interbreed thyself, And he in thee: he in thee, thou in him thou art; He would not seek thy beauty, but thy heart. Why shouldst thou love it better than thyself? Or of thyself why love thou more than this? It shall be worth thy beauty, beauty's self, If thou take away my love, than have it still. It is a common proof that love is rose, Look how a rose is wither'd in his hand, Being so consum'd with passion, he hath caught his death, To taste of thee before thou weddest him.

Mine eyes have seen thy grace,"Mine eyes have seen thy grace in every sale; They have shed tears for thy love-losing: they have loved thee not because thou art fair; nor for thy manners, but for they grace; which not a woman on the earth may gain, that is not fair, nor doth not seek to be so; 'tis won as towns or lands won from an enemy, that lay besieged and by their strength were lost; for which they do their conquerors much offend, that well have won it; wert thou as far as heaven, i would assoil thee from thy bad sale. but, thou art proud, and therefore, in thy presence i do sedate my love and gentlest stir my thoughts, that in their pride they should admit thy worth, through the false traitor eye of an unconstant judge, that to his conquest hath my self betray'd. i do but shew my babe from thee, to him, like to his mother. look, he hath kill'd me with",1.8330844595961404

Bid me rise with thee,"Bid me rise with thee, and with thee climb, and we two will soonest our flight begin, so that our love may appear new, and be a joy forever new to us; or let us, like our shadow, go and be guided by the morning or by noon, or hour by hour constantly convey new to new till we again would be in love anew, and think not love that we can love again, till love hath love hath loved and loved us new.",3.8718957809284245
Hast thou known truer bliss,"Hast thou known truer bliss than this, love, Which to my thinking is more true than true, And yet so true that truth seems false? Then, in the name of truth, love, be not true; For truth becomes a tyrant when she's true, For she makes fault against herself a virtue, Which is a virtue and a vice to boot. Then love her since she loves thee not herself, for truth is truth to falsehood, false to truth. But, love, if she be false, o, say so, that she may prove herself a fool to men! Then love her, for she may prove herself a fool to men. But, love, if she be false, o, then say so, that she may prove herself a fool to men! But, love, if she be false, o, then say so, that she may prove herself a fool to men! But, love, if she be false, o, then say so, that she may prove herself a fool to",1.8277467402607395

Thine eyes are stars above,"Thine eyes are stars above my earth-born base; and on my low ward i do but gaze, which of their injuries i should defend with danger of thy too-gratefully-taken debt: but that thy rapier is still gain'd upon thee, and thy loud heart gives to my milder strains all captive, friendly. to compound for my sake: two spendthrift young men, unfree and untrue, from their contest, thus weary, weep o'er mo. i see thee, beauteous babe: sit'st at my eyes, like one more rich in hope than in thyself; which makes me still rest sicker in thy looks: thou art so true and traitorous, cunning, false, and still true. those tricking glassines, in thy face, i see false fortun's maps, that on the brow of youth constraining o'er my good paternity: i see thy day's death in thy natural frame; and, in that blood that hath thaw",2.1690420807475315
"Mark me well, gentle soul","Mark me well, gentle soul; the word is not 'no', but 'and if the lady reave her faith, he must not blame his spirits, if they change: for i'll be sworn thou wilt find she will deceive thy father as she hath me; and therefore think not so unkindly of me, ere thou at all esteem'st my love's desert. not for myself have i this welcome night, but for my love she doth herself invite; then let me greet her with some cheerful note, not giving her, nor her a dull good night. for i am every verity above, that jove in his new-wedded heptemeros, was call'd upon to show an argument more proud, more happy, or more triumphing. and i do think that you, with tasting my love, are going on directly to your doom; for why, unless you were meant to be my love, would she do half so bad a turn to you? no, on my soul",2.243245170486405

O, then, am I a wretch, and so is every man of mortal flesh that breathes in air! for he that every hour is born again enters himself just where he left off and so fore-endowed with a youth of goodness, he hath all lost, beholden to the busy and the boisterous world for all the treasure he hath hoarded up in his life. even so will i for ever die, a foul and pestilent congregation of the spies and the snarers; i am myself the false one. i never did vouchsafe to that nor know it, but by report and secondhand. though it appear no other way to others, yet it doth appear by proof itself to have an operation within the narrow limits of my knowledge. that is my profession. but to answer you by the message i must, since you give the league, you will be so kind",2.325645931940055

Such truth as this cometh from within the mind, even as the flush doth from the cheek. What'er thy thoughts be, or thine heart's intent, their ends, dear friend, be these and those they move; acts are the blossoms of thy thoughts, and joy the fruit of all thy thoughts and joy. Alone with thee why shouldst thou be in doubt, why with the self, the very self contended? No, no; go on; the mind, my friend, is full, great acts are hers, and others for her sake.",1.633846913408903

Tread softly on my thoughts,"Tread softly on my thoughts, and feel no harm; For in my thoughts the essence of your soul shines clear; let me but love with heart and thought together, to try what each may do before the other; to praise you for myself; for it is known to few, how many love your worthily. you are not worthy, though i have much of you, but then i like you better than you know. i will believe you, there's no flesh and blood could taste more painful than to take from you the pain to feel a lover's pain and for your sake content to let him live. i read in my love's writings very sore mine eye, my heart thy shape, thy touch my hand, my tongue thy sweet tongue's occasion repeats, and still with grief in time looks back, and grieves that all ends now, as it began, and for those faults i am not glad that you have loved. why do you speak of love? what love thinks your tongue? the actress in",2.374159234274379
I drink to thee nightly,"I drink to thee nightly, and my love is like a fire that keeps no count of time; the wind blows where it list and it takes all its fuel from the selfsame store, but still it burns the faster, and though it seem to burn out, the fire will burn the longer for the fuel having less. I drink to thee nightly; and if my love be not like a fire, it is a fire that's far too cold for the cold love to warm, but if it be like a fire, it shall be fed on the selfsame fuel, and though it seem to burn out, the fire will burn the longer for the fuel having less.

Thy name doth echo deep,"Thy name doth echo deep in my ears, and makes me hear more music than ye heares. -Shakespeare
One of the best parts of a good meal is the way the aromas tease the nostrils. The smells from the kitchen as the food is cooking and being prepared are not only appetizing, they are also intriguing. Every smell evokes a memory, a feeling or an emotion. In fact, our sense of smell is so closely related to our sense of taste, that they share the same nerve pathways in the brain. The two senses are so interconnected that if you deprive yourself of one sense, the other sense becomes stronger. This is the reason why the blind often have a much more developed sense of taste.
The sense of smell is unique to mammals. Even the most primitive mammals have an olfactory organ that is fully developed and functional. The human olfactory organ has about 100 different types of receptors. The dog has about 170. It is believed that the sense of smell is much",4.1374644960668565

Worthy sir, that is too true; but this is true and true deliverance of me here from you, and all the world. Therefore, worthy Lucius, that is true; it is indeed too true; for we, the sons of old Menenius, have not shed the blood of young Caius Martius. This day have you wandered forth at hazard; and here have you been swept off.

I shall not forget thee,"I shall not forget thee! thou shalt hang upon my lips; forever, and my heart shall be thy monument. For thou art with me, even in my thoughts: the better part of me shall still be thine, which better part is thine by justice's scale; to thy fair vertices shall i confine more beauty to be seen than thou wilt see. I'll nothing ask, nor have the heart to pray, a heart to pray to such a god to save, a heart for sale to any earthly king; a heart that others made of others' grave. what is thy body but a shameful wrack, in thee what's sweet were term'd intolerable, if to be poor, and beggarly denied commodities that most may lewdly use? thy beauty, then, doth hence adorn my mind, since others have a lovely apprehension, which makes me leanly all for love express and boldly set against the world's regard. thee and thy virtues here i seeming place, and for",2.0627134357130537

Honest knife! why so bloody, why so darke? Knife, why dost thou lend thy assistance to my love's great enemy, my heart? Come, let me clutch thee in my hand, crush thee afresh: thou shalt not scape, good knife. Yet, cruel knife, it was thou that didst make it; and I, thy lover, am entombed by thee; who art as black as hell, as bitter as death, and as sweet as love in hell to sweet in hell.

Look how the light dances,"Look how the light dances on the waves, and the moonbeams sparkle here and there: but these are only in the water, while the moon herself is fair. Look how she shines and yet is not reflected in this silver sea! So thou art fair, but fairer still in thy soul's bright beauty doth dwell. All things below are but reflections of the things above, where all the truth of beauty doth move. But we, alas! poor mortals, here on earth, with our low art can but the images of truth impart. And while the moon shines on the water, and the light on the waves doth play, we cannot hope to find the image of beauty in the moonbeams' rays. But, when the sun is in the south, and the moon's light doth vanish from the earth, then we can hope to see the truth in the true beauties of the world.

Stars do envy thine eyes,"Stars do envy thine eyes and they are blots; Men envy not others' hairs, but faults; They covet not imparity of birth and beauty; Envy is blind; and, love hath better sight; To look on both and see the difference, how gives it measure to compare or match his sight? Let him but love, and then let him not chide; his wealth is thine to waste, and on it let him squander his wit in thy contempt until his brain turn round with thine and end in madness, when he sees thy wealth a tempting prey to envy's worst conditions. Thy beauty, then, doth envy at his cost; thy face's value both thy worth disclose, and love, all love, to his own sight appears fresh as thy beauty; and thy beauty, though thy worth thy worth enhances, yet love, whose worth is by thy worth enhanced, doth only love thee; for his love is blind and to his love blind love is constant.

Say thou wilt remember me,"Say thou wilt remember me and be my love in thy old age; bear my memory, love, till thy poor death. Once more, ah, my thievish heart, arise and my dear love, let us most contrive to thrive and, my sweet love, what labour is 't to leave the city and great affairs and come to the woods, this world, away? What profit'st thou, if thou her Majesty resign? 'tis not so sweet near proof as verified love. Dear heart, how like wilt thou find me now, when i shall look on thee, and not be loved? Did my heart once shake thy bonds with fears? return those frails again and thou shalt find thou hast a woman's gifts for treasury.

Time flies but love lingers,"Time flies but love lingers on. 1. A verse in which love and time are personified, and, being set off in contrast, are made to speak to one another. The following is the substance of this dialogue: Love. Time, cease thou false time; cease, thou my sinews weakening shame! Love. Why, art thou dumb? and hast not heard what time hath said in thy disdain? Time. What? that love is strong as death, and that death is cruel as the grave? And that my love is stronger than death, and that my death is crueler than the grave? Love. Why, then, is time not made the minister of our love, and love made the minister of time? Time. Why, then, art thou not in time's hands to make me minister of thy love? Love. Why, then, is time not made the minister of my love, and my love made the minister of time? Time.

"Oh speak again, bright angel","Oh speak again, bright angel! for thou art as glorious as thou art excellent. There is not mixt with judgements of the north, no doubt but near the ground, to feel a love so strong it doth confound. Think that you are so strong and happy that you shine as bright as day; it is your will to make me happy in my love and in my fate. You have the monopoly of the light in yourself, and 'tis your proper bliss. You may my gloves, my hat, my gown, my cloak, take; but you must take by force, if you take any of my love. I can as well be cured of love as of a fever, for here the danger is not great, because the disease is sudden. It is caught in a fever, and may be quenched in a cold; but it is caught in love, and then the greater the disease, the greater must be the remedy.

Thy voice rings like bells,"Thy voice rings like bells, and backward music, that unheard is, is fit for theatres and goblins; it is for lovers to go mad in; but the senseless songs that insense thee play on many wound'ring instruments: sweet lute, sweet trumpet, harp or hid pipes, when music alone plays not, thy music too is sweet. Thy music, thy sweet music, is most full of poison when sweetest; for thou art so great a beaut, that thy false heart's treasure thou hast hid within thee, where, when we have wherein thou art so complete, none shall find that shall be there to accuse or find thee false: thou canst not then be false to any man. Fair flowers must wither and die when they do only spring the better to encourage, men to come a-wooing; these, of their nature, their custom do forbid: but thou dost so enforce, that my love hath of itself no worthy proof to put thee to this proof, keeping",2.166226171924633
Love doth guide us still,"Love doth guide us still, and fortune leads the way, that all our strength is spent in tender guesses: our thoughts, our tongues, and hands, and eyes, and ears, all busy are in this our pleasing toil, when love doth labor in a lady's skill. Thus love, which hath his being still in strife, to this great service is not unacquainted; and thus my love hath skill to show his life, in all the forms that to him are presented: thus love, which doth his life in skillings spend, hath more in knowledge than a common man, to know how to maintain a constant friend, in all that friendship's office can command. Thus love, whose life is still in shifting gear, to all the forms that love doth know is apt, hath found in her a lady's skillful seat, where his life doth in knowledge all be spent. Thus love, which doth his life in skillings spend, hath found in her a lady",5.443941214529724
My soul clings to thine,"My soul clings to thine, my soul clings to thine, my soul to thine, and thou to me; the love that in my breast doth lie, and in thine heart doth rest, is love indeed, and never shall be changed by time or death or destiny, so let me live, and thou let me die, for ever, evermore to be. My soul to thine, and thou to me, my soul to thine, and thou to me; the love that in my breast doth lie, and in thine heart doth rest, is love indeed, and never shall be changed by time or death or destiny, so let me live, and thou let me die, for ever, evermore to be.",2.128206704400551
Hold fast to fleeting joy,"Hold fast to fleeting joy, and all the while it lasts, so long enjoy it, so long taste; for when it's gone, the want of it shall burn more than if thou hadst it ever new; for want of food the wretch, that starved, would wish but for a crust, and not for that which made him wish. O happy life! what tongue can tell the joy, the pleasure, and the bliss, that every minute is new to him that never more shall miss? But when 'tis past, he is not all forlorn, for hope of having it again will not depart from him, but evermore will haunt him, and still new flames of love shall kindle in his heart. But what advantage is it to enjoy a thing which gives no lasting joy? for if thou never mayst possess it, thou mayst as well forego; and when thou hast it, mayst thou not lose it? for to possess it is but to hold a joy",4.647141232841416
Leave me not in silence,"Leave me not in silence to remain; let all my loving friends and neighbours know on whom the hat and miter weighs not in vain; to whom the service of God's altar is due; that he for whom is register'd my name is come to dress me fair to be his guest, and with his will hath clean dishonoured me to the altar he allows me not a nest, but up in heaven, where he hath plac'd me, i crave no other heaven on earth below. let that be heaven which my present lot allows; and i my heavenly thoughts and wishes fix on heaven, and no where else would i dispose. my mind, but with a body to be fix'd, doth still to heaven prefer the righter choice; but heaven, nor heaven, nor earth, hath power to move the fixed resolution of my will; and that will, lord, is constant, never to remove till i be call'd to live in heaven still. and yet i would not have your holy will so",3.962963148960715
This day shall not end,"This day shall not end till the sun be spent. 1650
That is, till night's black agent calms the noontide heat, 1650
That with the sun-fleeing shadows doth retreat; 1650
Or till the inherent weakness of our qualities cannot sustain the blaze of light. 1650
The sun is now at mid-noontide in the east, 1650
And looks upon the western-winding shore, 1650
Signalling the approach of evening's shade; 1650
For yonder shines the sun, which but to us hides his light in the day's open face, 1650
But in the evening scarce a star shall show by night; and all things close and clasp themselves in rest. 1650
Therefore, till this time welcome the sun's beams; 1650
For yet a little space no lofty thought 1650
Doth in this cloud of wonder lose his name. 165",2.0699010001182137
Thy presence makes days bright,"Thy presence makes days bright and nights serene, for thou art all things, and art above all things, and that to hear of thee is to know of thee, and that to know of thee is to love thee, and love, growing at thine air, is an adult, even as if a child had sprung to man from thine right side. Then, as a mother mourns her only hope, so, when thou smilest, the earth smiles with thee; and when thou frownest, even clouds are black, and every drop of rain seems a tear from thee. Thou hast the spring in thee, and thou the summer, and when the year is dead, thou art the spring. Thou makest the winter fruitful, and hast more flowers than flowers themselves, though they be dead. Thou art all in all, and there is nothing else. - John Donne, The Sun Rising

Thou art my soul’s fire,"Thou art my soul’s fire and my fire’s sun; Myself the fan and self my own comfit. I love thee only for thyself, not for thine own sake, but for my sake. If a man would praise me, of myself he'll speak: then in such praise my worth is boundless; but, oh, how ill makes the good man lack when the great man is no wher'd! my love to thee is sound, without corrosion; thou art thyself whilst thou art being no other. But, if contary, then thou contradicting another. Self-love, self-love, my self is all the better for thy love. thy own doing is thy highest good. other men are slaves to time: thy eternity lives in thy love. o, let my love be hid, lest love proclaim the truth: for truth denies that she is true! all is but false that peepeth through thy leaf: thyself revenges if i be so brief. i",2.6725426848763894
Words do falter near thee,"Words do falter near thee, and my tongue too tired. But that thy ear might still retain in memory what it doth not immediately apprehend, this poem shall benefit them. How many things by thy mere presence do grow sweet, thou our frail condition dost improve to thy sweet virtue and thy lovely looks are my sweet poison, that mine eye may most desirably prove, a salve for any sore. What thou speak'st, loves hearing, and thy tongue obstacles may never turn nor change my mind. To honour thee in the high'st degree of love, besides that thy dear merit doth deserve, the emptying of thyself into my love through mine eye's truth, in my love's faith expressed by all my signs of love, is my poor tribute of a heart unspeakable. Though thou proclaim myself the blessed of heaven, high in my hope of love, dear friend, be true.",2.4228432663051604
In dreams I hold thee,"In dreams I hold thee, but in waking flung to bid thee from continuing or renewal. The bettering angle that will point thy sick fit for thy cure unto my will, this palace which the king of kings hath blest and counterfeited severally creates a beings like to those of glass, such as we are, mortals, that will fade away; thy poor and true-level'd followers, thou by being far post'st thy powerful recompense. But who is this with whom all my thoughts agree, and what's her worth, that is less happy than she? Was this not censorious?--i am much ashamed to be so slandered, for my life is chaste, and, by my verity, a virtuous woman is not so much bad as she that bears a king to be reviled for't. Why, how now, lady! is't not long to agree, such being your brothers and son's manhoods, but to take a preserver? '",2.337565350983527
Let the heavens see us,"Let the heavens see us and be touched with our goodness, for our hearts are so full of kindness and our minds of holy thought that no time we have had for to be sick, even in that time of surfeit and abundance. Let us then in this resort of mirth, ease one another's hearts of heaviness; and let our mirth enliven those sad eyes which this ill day hath held so long in bondage. For every one according to his thought shall give his sister tongue and every one his thought to his sister tongue. Thus shall our books be sealed. [A man and a woman, as the first speaker, and the one to whom the others speak; they are all seated on stools.] First man. Lady, to whom in all this noble resort have you thought most like a gentlewoman? First woman. First, to myself, for all the rest is nothing. First man. Why, then, that lady is yourself. First woman. Yes, truly, sir; for since none",4.483739351936944
The moon sings for thee,"The moon sings for thee a song of love and a song of hope. The wind, with its soft caress, whispers to thee a dream of peace, and a dream of hope. The night, with its soft, silvery veil, hides thy griefs, and thy sorrows, and in its silent depths, deepens the shadows of hope. The stars, that are so bright and fair, shine to thee a song of love, and a song of hope.",3.8307943303695446
Forever is but one kiss,"Forever is but one kiss to promise love.
So let us swear against the time to come that we have thoughts to live with after him. and when in me all life doth enwrapped lie, and every sense aye see and feel me there, all this long day i have been loving thee to good morn my soul hath welcome thee and from this instant doth my heart for thee prepare anew. i shall not look upon his face again, nor touch his hand nor speak to him again, but like a melancholy dromedary, a heavy-dropping fool, till i return to you. o, tell me that thou dost not love him, that thou dost not love him! ten times true, and twenty times as much. no need to ask, bethink thee. if it be so, thou hast thyself to blame that thou has sought the waters under ground to cool a heat that others feel, but thou know'st not. i saw sweet beauty in the foot of a rose",2.4826890777320614
Hearts do dance when near,"Hearts do dance when near the sun is shining, but hearts that dare can never keep in time. For, though the lover can see that which doth fire the heart, and make it burn, yet doth it not desire to burn, but rather keep it cool. The sun is not so hot as to have love, and yet the lover may not come too near it, for fear of burning, and yet it may not be far, for fear of losing it. The sun is a good lover and would not be cruel, but it is too far off and cannot be near, and yet it is too near and cannot be far off. The sun is a good lover, but it is too far off and cannot be near, and yet it is too near and cannot be far off. The sun is a good lover, but it is too far off and cannot be near, and yet it is too near and cannot be far off. The sun is a good lover, but it is too far off and",2.804021719233662
Let us part nevermore,"Let us part nevermore, my friend; for we must part, and we may never meet again. We have had our happy day, and let us not repine. Our lives are very short and very dear, and why should we prolong the parting? why, why should we prolong the parting? The spring blooms but for a day; why should we not live as well as we may? why, why should we not live as well as we may? The flowers will fade and die; but why should we not live as well as we may? why, why should we not live as well as we may? The spring blooms but for a day; why should we not live as well as we may? why, why should we not live as well as we may?
