Data_Cleaning.ipynb provides the procedure to clean and merge all Shakespeare's works into 1 document.

Metadata-mit.csv provides the metadata of each work, while the Shakespeare-main.zip is the zip of all of his literature except Elegy. Elegy work has its file (in elegy.txt). 

Passing through the preprocessing, the final result of the cleaning data is in the shakespeare_preprocess.zip
