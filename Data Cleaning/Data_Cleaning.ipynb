the tide of this surrounding age\\n        (When now his father\\'s death had freed his will)\\n        Could make him subject to the drunken rage\\n70      Of such whose only glory is their ill.\\n        He from the happy knowledge of the wise\\n        Draws virtue to reprove secured fools\\n        And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice\\n        To spend his spring of days in sacred

Expecting ever to be overthrown;\\n175     When the proud height of much affected sin\\n        Shall ripen to a head, and in that pride\\n        End in the miseries it did begin\\n        And fall

Which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe.\\n        Here shall be reckoned up the constant faith,\\n        Never untrue, where once he love professed;\\n185     Which is a miracle in men, one

Of all alike beloved and lamented.\\n205     And I here to thy memorable worth,\\n        In this last act of friendship, sacrifice\\n        My love to thee, which I could not set forth\\n        In

to thrive,\\n460     Not vexed with envy of priority,\\n          And those are much more noble in the mind\\n          Than many that have nobleness by kind.\\n        Birth, blood, and ancestors, are none of ours,\\n        Nor can we make a proper challenge to them\\n465     But virtues and perfections in our powers\\n        Proceed most truly from us, if we do them.\\n        Respective titles or a gracious style,\\n        With all what men in eminence possess,\\n        Are, without ornaments to praise them, vile:\\n470     The beauty of the mind is nobleness.\\n        And such as have that beauty, well deserve\\n        Eternal characters, that after death\\n        Remembrance of their worth we may preserve,\\n        So that their glory die not with their breath.\\n475     Else what avails it in a goodly strife\\n        Upon this face of earth here to contend,\\n        The good t\\' exceed the wicked in their life,\\n        Should both be like obscured in their end?\\n        Until which end, there is none rightly can\\n480     Be termed happy, since the happiness\\n        Depends upon the goodness of the man,\\n        Which afterwards his praises will express.\\n        Look hither then, you that enjoy the youth\\n        Of your best days, and see how unexpected\\n485     Death can betray your jollity to ruth\\n        When death you think is least to be respected!\\n        The person of this model here set out\\n        Had all that youth and happy days could give him,\\n        Yet could not all-encompass him about\\n490     Against th\\' assault of death, who to relieve him\\n        Strook home but to the frail and mortal parts\\n        Of his humanity, but could not touch\\n        His flourishing and fair long-lived deserts,\\n        Above fate\\'s reach, his singleness was such.\\n495     So that he dies but once, but doubly lives,\\n        Once in his proper self, then in his name;\\n        Predestinated time, who all deprives,\\n        Could never yet deprive him of the same.\\n        And had the genius which attended on him\\n500     Been possibilited to keep him safe\\n        Against the rigor that hath overgone him,\\n        He had been to the public use a staff,\\n        Leading by his example in the path\\n        Which guides to doing well, wherein so few\\n505     The proneness of this age to error hath\\n        Informed rightly in the courses true.\\n        As then the loss of one, whose inclination\\n        Stove to win love in general, is sad,\\n        So specially his friends, in soft compassion\\n510     Do feel the greatest loss they could have had.\\n        Amongst them all, she who those nine of years\\n        Lived fellow to his counsels and his bed\\n        Hath the most share in loss; for I in hers\\n        Feel what distemperature this chance hath bred.\\n515     The chaste embracements of conjugal love,\\n        Who in a mutual harmony consent,\\n        Are so impatient of a strange remove\\n        As meager death itself seems to lament,\\n        And weep upon those cheeks which nature framed\\n520     To be delightful orbs in whom the force\\n        Of lively sweetness plays, so that ashamed\\n        Death often pities his unkind divorce.\\n        Such was the separation here constrained\\n        (Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),\\n525     For in his life his love was so unfeigned\\n        As he was both an husband and a father. . .\\n        The one in firm affection and the other\\n        In careful providence, which ever strove\\n        With joint assistance to grace one another\\n530     With every helpful furtherance of love.\\n        But since the sum of all that can be said\\n        Can be but said that \"He was good\" (which wholly\\n        Includes all excellence can be displayed\\n        In praise of virtue and reproach of folly).\\n535       His due deserts, this sentence on him gives,\\n          \"He died in life, yet in his death he lives.\"\\n        Now runs the method of this doleful song\\n        In accents brief to thee, O thou deceased!\\n        To whom those pains do only all belong\\n540     As witnesses I did not love thee least.\\n        For could my worthless brain find out but how\\n        To raise thee from the sepulcher of dust,\\n        Undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now\\n        Of life with me, and heaven be counted just\\n545     If to a supplicating soul it would\\n        Give life anew, by giving life again\\n        Where life is missed; whereby discomfort should\\n        Right his old griefs, and former joys retain\\n        Which now with thee are leaped into thy tomb\\n550     And buried in that hollow vault of woe,\\n        Expecting yet a more severer doom\\n        Than time\\'s strict flinty hand will let \\'em know.\\n        And now if I have leveled mine account\\n        And reckoned up in a true measured score\\n555     Those perfect graces which were ever wont\\n        To wait on thee alive, I ask no more\\n        (But shall hereafter in a poor content\\n        Immure those imputations I sustain,\\n        Learning my days of youth so to prevent\\n560     As not to be cast down by them again);\\n        Only those hopes which fate denies to grant\\n        In full possession to a captive heart\\n        Who, if it were in plenty, still would want\\n        Before it may enjoy his better part:\\n565     From which detained, and banished in th\\' exile\\n        Of dim misfortune, has none other prop\\n        Whereon to lean and rest itself the while\\n        But the weak comfort of the hapless, \"hope.\"\\n        And hope must in despite of fearful change\\n570     Play in the strongest closet of my breast,\\n        Although perhaps I ignorantly range\\n        And court opinion in my deep\\'st unrest.\\n        But whether doth the stream of my mischance\\n        Drive me beyond myself, fast friend, soon lost,\\n575     Long may thy worthiness thy name advance\\n        Amongst the virtuous and deserving most,\\n          Who herein hast forever happy
